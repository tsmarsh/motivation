        <p>Mess up orders<span class="details">Get quantities wrong, confuse names, and send things to the wrong addresses.</span></p>
        <p>Drag out communications<span class="details">Keep back-and-forth emails going forever, especially with government offices.</span></p>
        <p>Misfile important stuff<span class="details">Put critical documents in the wrong place so nobody can find them.</span></p>
        <p>Short on copies<span class="details">When making copies, always make one less than needed, so someone has to redo the work./span></p>
        <p>Delay important calls<span class="details">Tell important people that the boss is "busy" or on another call, even when they’re not.</span></p>
        <p>Hold onto mail<span class="details">Don't send mail out right away—wait for the next collection.</span></p>

        <h1>How to disrupt as an employee</h1>
        <p>Slow and steady (in a bad way)<span class="details">Work super slow. Use the wrong tools, like a tiny hammer when you need a big one. Take the long way around every task.</span></p>
        <p>Find excuses to pause<span class="details">Take forever when switching materials. Measure things way more than needed. Take extended bathroom breaks. “Forget” your tools so you have to go back for them.</span></p>
        <p>Pretend you don’t get it<span class="details">Even if you understand instructions, act like you don’t. Especially if they're in another language—play clueless.</span></p>
        <p>Ask a million questions<span class="details">Act like instructions are confusing. Keep asking for clarification or bug your boss constantly, pretending you really want to "get it right."/span></p>
        <p>Do a bad job and blame your tools<span class="details">Mess up your work and blame the tools or equipment. Complain that they're holding you back from doing a good job.</span></p>
        <p>Gatekeep your skills<span class="details">Never teach new workers what you know. Let them figure it out the hard way.</span></p>
        <p>Mess with paperwork<span class="details">Fill out forms so badly that they have to be redone. Miss out key info on purpose.</span></p>
        <p>Form annoying employee groups<span class="details">Join or start a group to raise "issues" with management. Make the process complicated, with lots of meetings and unnecessary problems.</span></p>
        <p>Send stuff to the wrong place<span class="details">Misroute materials or parts just to create chaos.</span></p>
        <p>Mix it up<span class="details">Combine good parts with scrap and rejected stuff so no one knows what’s what.</span></p>

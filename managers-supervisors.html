        <h1>How to disrupt as a manager</h1>
        <p>"I need it in writing"<span class="details">Always demand written orders, no exceptions.</span></p>
        <p>Play dumb<span class="details">Pretend you don’t get the orders. Ask a million questions or start an email thread that never ends. Nitpick every little thing.</span></p>
        <p>Delay everything<span class="details">Hold off on delivering anything until all parts of an order are ready, even if some parts are already good to go.</span></p>
        <p>Don't restock until it's too late<span class="details">Wait until you're practically out of supplies before you order more. That way, any delay means work comes to a grinding halt.</span></p>
        <p>Go for the Gucci materials<span class="details">Always ask for the best stuff that's hard to get. If you don’t get it, complain. Warn everyone that using anything else will mess up the quality.</span></p>
        <p>Give the wrong jobs to the wrong people<span class="details">Hand out the easy tasks first, then give the hard, important stuff to the people who are least likely to do it well.</span></p>
        <p>Demand perfection on the unimportant<span class="details">Be super picky about things that don’t matter, but ignore real problems in stuff no one can see.</span></p>
        <p>Send things to the wrong place<span class="details">Intentionally mess up the routing so parts and materials end up where they don’t belong.</span></p>
        <p>Mess up new hires<span class="details">Give newbies half-baked instructions, making sure they’re confused from the start.</span></p>
        <p>Reward slackers, trash the stars<span class="details">Be extra nice to the workers who suck, even promote them. But for the ones doing a great job? Complain about their work and kill their vibe.</span></p>
        <p>Meetings > work<span class="details">Schedule unnecessary meetings right when there’s real work to be done.</span></p>
        <p>Paperwork overload<span class="details">Make extra paperwork seem like a must. Start duplicate files, just because.</span></p>
        <p>More hoops to jump through<span class="details">Make sure at least three people have to sign off on something that could've been approved by just one./span></p>
        <p>Stick to the rules (too much)<span class="details">Follow every single rule to the letter, even when it makes no sense.</span></p>
